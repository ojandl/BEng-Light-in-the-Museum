This project, entitled Light in the Museum, demonstrates the potential of Visible Light Communication (VLC)
as a means of data transmission. VLC is efficient by providing illumination combined with
high-speed data transmission, offering an alternative to radio frequency communication methods where
spectral limits have been reached, or interference is an issue. The bi-directional system design features
custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and is fundamentally based on Variable Pulse Position Modulation (VPPM).
Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGA) boards are used to achieve high-speed data
processing. A user interface can initiate the transmission of an RGB-encoded image through a free-space
downlink channel. A 153.6 kB image can be reconstructed in 6.9 s using a data rate of 200 kbit/s combined
with Hamming (8, 1) code for single-bit error detection at the receiver end. The project achieved a
Bit Error Rate (BER) of 1.9Eâˆ’4 for a channel length of 20 cm, demonstrating the reliability and feasibility
of VLC for future wireless communication applications. An image was reconstructed with channel
lengths up to 60 cm at variable white-LED dimming levels. The project was designed to be displayed at
the Museum of Communications as an example of VLC technology
